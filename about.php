			China has long been troubled by severe water contamination. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, 280 million people use unsafe drinking water. Half of the urban drinking water supplies do not meet national standards. Government is currently in a transition period to make water quality information more public, but most communities are still left in the dark about the quality of the water they are exposed to.

		<br>
		<p style="font-size:18px">
			"MyH2O" is created to help Chinese people understand better their drinking water and associated health risks. We gather credible water quality info from published research, government monitoring agencies and university labs. We stimulate local water testing campaigns by distributing affordable water quality testing kits to university students, NGOs and community volunteers. We aims to make water quality accessible to people at all age, and advocate for clean potable water for China with the power of crowd sourcing and community engagement.<br>

			We believe 1 + 1 = 11. The passion, dedication and generosity of resources from our supporters and collaborators are crucial to make this happen:
